## About me

I am pursuing Double major in Statistics and Actuarial Science (B.Sc.) from Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. I use data to understand problems and propose ideas, with a detail-oriented approach. 

I have studied statistical models and data science throughout University years and am constantly seeking more knowledge. In my activities I aim to reduce repetitive work by automating tasks and mapping/ improving processes.
