## About me

I am currently double majoring in Statistics and Actuarial Science (B.Sc.) at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. In my studies, I have focused on using data to understand problems and propose solutions, taking a detail-oriented approach. 

Throughout my university years, I have studied statistical models and data science, and I am always looking to expand my knowledge in these areas. In my activities, I strive to minimize repetitive work by automating tasks and streamlining processes.
